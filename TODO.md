## Prioritized Improvements (by Value/Effort Ratio)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration Test Status (Investigated)
Attempted to enable 11 ignored integration tests but found:
- **workflow_tests.rs** (4 tests): API incompatibilities with capture/export/query modules
- **multi_repo_integration_tests.rs** (7 tests): Missing imports and API changes needed
- Tests compile but need significant refactoring to match current API
- Estimated effort increased from 2 hrs to 4-6 hrs due to API alignment needs

## Task Priority List

### üéØ High Value, Low Effort (Do First)
1. [~] **Fix Integration Tests** - 11 tests need API updates (4-6 hrs)
   - Import issues with ExportFormat, PrivacyConfig
   - QueryEngine API changes needed
   - Language enum not exposed from project module
   - CollaborationManager needs proper imports
   - Mock LSP server references need fixing
2. [ ] **Add CLI Command Examples** - Quick start guide with common use cases (3 hrs)
3. [ ] **Fix Connection Pool Semaphore** - Resolve early permit release issue (4 hrs)
4. [ ] **Generate API Documentation** - Auto-generate with cargo doc (2 hrs)

### üí° Medium Value, Low-Medium Effort
5. [ ] **Add Monorepo Detection** - Support Lerna, Nx, Rush, Yarn workspaces (6 hrs)
6. [ ] **Setup Benchmark Dashboard** - CI regression detection with criterion (3 hrs)
7. [ ] **Wire Privacy Policy Integration** - Connect to capture service (8 hrs)
8. [ ] **Enable Quick-Fix Verification** - Automated fix validation (10 hrs)

### üìù Lower Priority (Higher Effort)
9. [ ] Multi-repository features - Complex implementation (2-3 weeks)
10. [ ] Web UI dashboard - Nice to have but not critical (1-2 weeks)
11. [ ] ML-based fix suggestions - Requires training data and models (3-4 weeks)
12. [ ] Additional build systems (Bazel, Buck) - Low demand currently (1 week each)

### Known TODOs in Codebase (19 items)
- Multi-repo features (11 TODOs) - placeholders for future multi-repository support
- Connection pool improvements (2 TODOs) - semaphore design optimization  
- Project detection (3 TODOs) - monorepo/workspace detection logic
- Cross-repo synchronization (2 TODOs) - future caching and sync features
- Privacy policy integration (1 TODO) - capture service enhancement
